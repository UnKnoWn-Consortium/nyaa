	<p><strong>5/18 Update:</strong> We've added an upload api for ease of uploading. See documentation <a href="https://github.com/nyaadevs/nyaa/blob/master/utils/api_uploader.py">here</a>.</p> 
	<p><strong>5/17 Update:</strong> We've added faster and more accurate search! In addition to your typical keyword search in both English and other languages, you can also now use powerful operators 
	like <kbd>clockwork planet -horrible</kbd> or <kbd>commie|horrible|cartel yowamushi</kbd> to search. For all supported operators, please click <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html#_simple_query_string_syntax">here</a>. More features are coming soon!</p><br>
